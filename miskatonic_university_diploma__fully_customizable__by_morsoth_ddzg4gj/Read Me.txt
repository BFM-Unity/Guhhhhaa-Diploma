If you click "Download", you'll have:
   - The original Photoshop (.psd) file

   - The Book Antiqua font,
   - The CloisterBlack font,
   - The Embassy font,
   - The EmilyAustin font,

Instructions:
   - Replace "Your Name" with the name of the student
   - Edit the name of the department
   - If wanted, edit the names of the signatories (or remove them and make the signatures with a pen)
   - Remove the cream background and the seal
   - Print on ivory or cream paper for more authenticity
   - Print the seal on its own, on white paper, and glue on the diploma!

Please note that the Miskatonic University Seal is a creation of Propnomicon and can be found here: https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://propnomicon.blogspot.com/2008/12/miskatonic-university-seal-redux.html

Updated seal with gold foil effect by capndeek373. Thanks!
